## Features

### 1. Learning Material
- The material is divided into **three difficulty levels**: Beginner, Advanced, and Expert.
- Each level consists of **multiple chapters** to guide users through the learning process.
- **Chapter content** includes written material and programming concepts tailored to the user's level.

### 2. Testing and Progress
- After reading each chapter, students can take a test composed of **multiple-choice**, **true/false**, or **fill-the-gap** questions.
- **Passing score** is set at 60% or higher; failing requires the user to revisit the material before reattempting the test.
- On their **first login**, students can opt to take an initial test to be placed at the appropriate level. If they score well, they can **unlock chapters** and skip easier ones.
- **Progress** is rewarded with badges based on chapter completion and total score points.

### 3. User Profile
- **Profile pages** show progress, badges earned, and a breakdown of personal statistics.
- Track how far youâ€™ve advanced through the chapters and view your **total accumulated score**.

### 4. Teachers' Role

  - Add test questions to any chapter.
  - Inspect all students' progress, including **detailed analytics and performance metrics**.
